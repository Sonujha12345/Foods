        <p><b>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional 
            support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and
             contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats,
              proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by
               an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
                energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species
                 of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy 
                 the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a 
                 specific ecological niche within specific geographical contex

                 <p><b>humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different 
                    ecosystems. Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption. The 
                    majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry
                    , which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through 
                    complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of 
                    conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the 
                    food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate
                     change, accounting for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.[1]

                    The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and
                     political issues, including sustainability, biological diversity, economics,
                      population growth, water supply, and food security. Food safety and security 
                      are monitored by international agencies like the International Association 
                      for Food Protection, the World Resources Institute, the World Food Programme,
                       the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the International Food Informati

                       <p><b>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy
                         to an organism.[2][3] It can be raw, processed, or formulated and is cons

                         posed of water, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Minerals (e.g., 
                         salts) and organic substances (e.g., vitamins) can also be found in food.
                         [4] Plants, algae, and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make some
                          of their own nutrients.[5] Water is found in many foods and has been defi
                          ned as a food by itself.[6] Water and fiber have low energy densities, or
                           calories, while fat is the most energy-dense component.[3] Some inorgani

                        Human food can be classified in various ways, either by related content or
                         by how it is processed.[8] The number and composition of food groups can 
                         vary. Most systems include four basic groups that describe their origin
                          and relative nutritional function: Vegetables and Fruit, Cereals and Brea
                          d, Dairy, and Meat.[9] Studies that look into diet quality group food in
                          to whole grains/cereals, refined grains/cereals, vegetables, fruits, nut
                          s, legumes, eggs, dairy products, fish, red meat, processed meat, and su

                            primary producers at the bottom and apex predators at the top.[14] 
                            Other aspects of the web include detrovores (that eat detritis) and 
                            decomposers (that break down dead organisms).[14] Primary producers 
                            include algae, plants, bacteria and protists that acquire their energy 
                            from sunlight.[15] Primary consumers are the herbivores that consume the 
                            plants, and secondary consumers are the carnivores that consume those her
                            bivores. Some organisms, including most mammals and birds, diet consists 
                            of both animals and plants, and they are considered omnivores.[16] The ch
                            ain ends with the apex predators, the animals that have no known predator
                            s in its ecosystem.[17] Humans are considered apex predators.[18]

                            Humans are omnivores, finding sustenance in vegetables, fruits, cooked 
                            meat, milk, eggs, mushrooms and seaweed.[16] Cereal grain is a staple food 
                            that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.[19] 
                            Corn (maize), wheat, and rice account for 87% of all grain production wor
                            ldwide.[20][21][22] Just over half of the world's crops are used to feed
                             humans (55 percent), with 36 percent grown as animal feed and 9 percent 
                             for biofuels.[23] Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of
                              fermented foods like bread, wine, cheese and yogurt.[24] </b></p>

The oxygen is then released, and the glucose stored as an energy reserve.[29]

                                        Plants also absorb important nutrients and minerals from the air, natural waters, and soil.[30] Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are absorbed from the air or water and are the basic nutrients needed for plant survival.[31] The three main nutrients absorbed from the soil for plant growth are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, with other important nutrients including calcium, sulfur, magnesium, iron boron, chlorine, manganese, zinc, copper molybdenum and nickel.[31]
                                        
                                        Plants as a food source are divided into seeds, fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains and nuts.[32] Where plants fall within these categories can vary, with botanically described fruits such as the tomato, squash, pepper and eggplant or seeds like peas commonly considered vegetables.[33] Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the reproductive tissue, so seeds, nuts and grains are technically fruit.[34][35] From a culinary perspective, fruits are generally considered the remains of botanically described fruits after grains, nuts, seeds and fruits used as vegetables are removed.[36] Grains can be defined as seeds that humans eat or harvest, with cereal grains (oats, wheat, rice, corn, barley, rye, sorghum and millet) belonging to the Poaceae (grass) family[37] and pulses coming from the Fabaceae (legume) family.[38] Whole grains are foods that contain all the elements of the original seed (bran, germ, and endosperm).[39] Nuts are dry fruits, distinguishable by their woody shell.[36]
                                        
                                        Fleshy fruits (distinguishable from dry fruits like grain, seeds and nuts) can be further classified as stone fruits (cherries and peaches), pome fruits (apples, pears), berries (blackberry, strawberry), citrus (oranges, lemon), melons (watermelon, cantaloupe), Mediterranean fruits (grapes, fig), tropical fruits (banana, pineapple).[36] Vegetables refer to any other part of the plant that can be eaten, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, bark or the entire plant itself.[40] These include root vegetables (potatoes and carrots), bulbs (onion family), flowers (cauliflower and broccoli), leaf vegetables (spinach and lettuce) and stem vegetables (celery and asparagus).[41][40]
                                        
                                        The carbohydrate, protein and lipid content of plants is highly variable. Carbohydrates are mainly in the form of starch, fructose, glucose and other sugars.[32] Most vitamins are found from plant sources, with exceptions of vitamin D and vitamin B12. Minerals can also be plentiful or not. Fruit can consist of up to 90% water, contain high levels of simple sugars that contribute to their sweet taste, and have a high vitamin C content.[32][36] Compared to fleshy fruit (excepting Bananas) vegetables are high in starch,[42] potassium, dietary fiber, folate and vitamins and low in fat and calories.[43] Grains are more starch based[32] and nuts have a high protein, fibre, vitamin E and B content.[36] Seeds are a good source of food for animals because they are abundant and contain fibre and healthful fats, such as omega-3 fats.[44][45] Complicated chemical interactions can enhance or depress bioavailability of certain nutrients. Phytates can prevent the release of some sugars and vitamins.[32]
                                        
                                        Animals that only eat plants are called herbivores, with those that mostly just eat fruits known as frugivores,[46] leaves, while shoot eaters are folivores (pandas) and wood eaters termed xylophages (termites).[47] Frugivores include a diverse range of species from annelids to elephants, chimpanzees and many birds.[48][49][50] About 182 fish consume seeds or fruit.[51] Animals (domesticated and wild) use as many types of grasses that have adapted to different locations as their main source of nutrients.[52]
                                        
                                        Humans eat thousands of plant species; there may be as many as 75,000 edible species of angiosperms, of which perhaps 7,000 are often eaten.[53] Plants can be processed into breads, pasta, cereals, juices and jams or raw ingredients such as sugar, herbs, spices and oils can be extracted.[32] Oilseeds are pressed to produce rich oils – ⁣sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oil) and sesame.[54]
                                        
                                        Many plants and animals have coevolved in such a way that the fruit is a good source of nutrition to the animal who then excretes the seeds some distance away, allowing greater dispersal.[55] Even seed predation can be mutually beneficial, as some seeds can survive the digestion process.[56][57] Insects are major eaters of seeds,[44] with ants being the only real seed dispersers.[58] Birds, although being major dispersers,[59] only rarely eat seeds as a source of food and can be identified by their thick beak that is used to crack open the seed coat.[60] Mammals eat a more diverse range of seeds, as they are able to crush harder and larger seeds with their teeth.[61] </b></p>

This includes meat, eggs, shellfish and dairy products like milk and cheese.[62] They are an important source of protein and are considered complete proteins for human consumption as they contain all the essential amino acids that the human body needs.[63] One 4-ounce (110 g) steak, chicken breast or pork chop contains about 30 grams of protein. One large egg has 7 grams of protein. A 4-ounce (110 g) serving of cheese has about 15 grams of protein. And 1 cup of milk has about 8 grams of protein.[63] Other nutrients found in animal products include calories, fat, essential vitamins (including B12) and minerals (including zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium).[63]

                                                Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products (cheese, butter, etc.). Eggs laid by birds and other animals are eaten and bees produce honey, a reduced nectar from flowers that is used as a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures consume blood, such as in blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, or in a cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare.[64] </b></p>

                                            <p><b>Animals, specifically humans, typically have five different types of tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. The differing tastes are important for distinguishing between foods that are nutritionally beneficial and those which may contain harmful toxins.[65] As animals have evolved, the tastes that provide the most energy are the most pleasant to eat while others are not enjoyable,[66] although humans in particular can acquire a preference for some substances which are initially unenjoyable.[65] Water, while important for survival, has no taste.[67]

                                                Sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose, or disaccharides such as sucrose, a molecule combining glucose and fructose.[68] Sourness is caused by acids, such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include citrus, specifically lemons and limes. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it can signal a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria.[69] Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor. Bitter taste is a sensation considered unpleasant characterised by having a sharp, pungent taste. Unsweetened dark chocolate, caffeine, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter. Umami, commonly described as savory, is a marker of proteins and characteristic of broths and cooked meats.[70] Foods that have a strong umami flavor include cheese, meat and mushrooms.[71]
                                                Catfish have millions of taste buds covering their entire body.
